     <h2>HTML</h2>
     <ul>
             <li>An element is a specific type of content within a webpage. Common elements used in HTML are text elements, image elements, header elements and list elements.</li>
      <li>Beyond elements that can be seen on a page there are also elements that are used to divide content or describe content to browsers and developers.</li>
      <li>Elements used to divide and describe a webpage are known as meta-related elements, content division elements and semantic elements.</li>
      <li>HTML elements are typically made up of an opening and closing tag which is represented with angle brackets (< >). Inside these tags is everything that is included within an element (content and other nested elements).</li>
      <li>The head element contains information which helps a browser correctly render the webpage.</li>
      <li> Elements listed within the head are not seen by users when looking at a webpage.</li>
      <li>The header will appear at the top of a page and contains a navigation menu and/or introductory content.</li>
      <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
      <li>The footer will appear at the bottom of a page and contain information regarding the author, copyright, contact, sitemap and navigation.</li>
      <li> HTML attributes are always noted in the beginning element, never at the ending element.</li>
      <li> Elements that are found inside other elements are referred to as child elements, whereas the element which contains these child elements is known as the parent element.  </li>
      <li> When an HTML element is referred to as semantic it means the name of the element describes the content of the element and it's role played within the website.</li>
      <li> It is best practice for a coder to use semantic elements as much as possible, especially when working with visual content.</li>
      <li> When using HTML visual elements, the content is found listed between both an opening and closing tag.</li>
      <li>Opening tags are often noted with an associated name tag contained between angle brackets (ex. < header >).</li>
      <li>Closing tags appear the same as opening tags however they will have a forward slash before the associated name tag (ex. < /header >). </li>
      <li>HTML elements are case sensitive however declarations are not.</li>
      <li>HTML is made up of elements that preform distinct roles and include html, head, meta and title.</li>
      <li>The title element is required and is very important to improve Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
      <li>The style element defines the CSS styles within a webpage.</li>
      <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
      <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
      <li>The meta element defines metadata such as character set, description, keywords, author and viewpoint.</Li>
      <li>Elements used to represent the levels of a heading within a text block are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6.</li>
      <li>When using headings, it is important to use heading tags in order from h1 to h6 to make the page accessible.</li>
      <li>An element that represents a paragraph or block of text is a < p > element.</li>
      <li>HTML elements that represent bulleted or numbered lists are unordered lists < ul >, ordered lists < ol > and list items < li >.</li>
      <li>The element that contains information about images displayed on a webpage is < img > and it can contain various attributes.</li>
      <li>The most important attribute when it comes to webpage images is the src attribute because it will define the location of the image.</li>
      <li>To create a line of empty space between two blocks of content you use the < br > function.</li>
      <li>To create a link to a webpage you use the anchor < a > element.</li>
      <li>To point to the URL for a link within a webpage use the 'href' attribute.</li>
      <li>The 'alt' attribute contains a text string describing the appearance and functionality of an image. Alt text is important for screen readers as well as other assistive technologies and can also improve search engine rankings for websites.</li>
      <li>Semantic elements that define a section in a document containing thematic content are known as < section > elements.</section></li>

     <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
               <li>The three ways to style a webpage using CSS are inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet and external CSS style sheet.</li>
        <li>To style an element directly in the HTML file, inline CSS would be used. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
        <li>Inline styles are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever design changes are made.</li>
        <li>Using the 'style' attribute to change the color of a single heading is an example of inline CSS.</li>
        <li>Internal style sheets are used to embed an entire stylesheet directly into the HTML file.</li>
        <li>Internal style sheets contain CSS rules for a webpage which only apply to that page, can configure CSS classes and IDs and to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
        <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is most common because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes desing changes easier.</li>
        <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or delarations, will apply.</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property (ex. color:blue).</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page it only adds a buffer.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element. Increasing the padding makes the entire element bigger.</li>
        <li>Separation of concerns refers to separating code into different files based on use, following the principle that each section of code should have it's own responsibility.</li>
        <li>The CSS box model is the idea that every HTML element is essentially a box and each box consists of margins outside the element, the element's borders, padding and content.</li>
        <li>When applying a rule to all visible elements on a page you use a wild card symbol (*).</li>
        <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
        <li>The 'block' value is used to assign each image to start on a new line.</li>
        <li>A 'link' element creates a connection to an external file.</li>
        <li>The 'rel' attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and a linked document resource.</li>
        <li>The 'href' attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
        <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as 'gray' or 'blue'. The color can also be referred to by its hexadecimal code or hex #.</li>
        <li>To find a color and define it by its hex # go to (https://htmlcolorcodes.com/).</li>

     <h2>Git</h2>
     <ul>
               <li>Coding should never be done in the main branch but instead in a created feature branch.</li>
        <li>Branches should be named by the feature that will be developed to help specify the purpose of the branch.</li>
        <li>After a feature branch is created it is important to add commit messages detailing what changes have been made to the code. These commits should be very descriptive.</li>
        <li>Once changes have been made it is important to merge these changes to the main branch. The first step to doing this is to initiate a pull request. Once a pull request is approved and the branches have been merged, the code within the main branch will be updated with all changes.</li>
        <li>The git command must precede every Git statement</li>
        <li>checkout: used to move the current working branch to another branch.</li>
        <li>-b: used to create a new branch.</li>
        <li>add: adds modifications within the current branch</li>
        <li>-A: adds all changes</li>
        <li>pull: receives modifications from a branch into the local environment</li>
        <li>push: used to push changes from branch to local environment</li>
        <li>origin: indicates the source</li>
        <li>git commit: adds a commit message to describe what the commit contains</li>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <li>git pull origin main: checks to make sure the local branch is in sync with the base branch. Use before pushing a new version up to repo.</li>

     <h2>JavaScript</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is a dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type and any variable can be assigned and re-assigned values of all types.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is a weakly typed language; therefore it allows implicit type conversion when the operation involves mismatched types instead of throwing an error.</li>
        <li>When using JavaScript the keyword "var" is used to declare a variable and give it a unique name</li>
        <li>An assignment operator "=" is used to assign specific data that will be stored within a variable</li>
        <li>Every line of JavaScript ends with a semicolon</li>
        <li>The control flow, or order that a computer executes code, in JavaScript runs from the first statement to the last.</li>
        <li>Control flow can be interrupted by using conditional statements and loops to control the order in which the code is executed.</li>
        <li>Using an "if" statement is a way of adding decision-making into our code because the code will only execute if the statement meets a condition or is true.</li>
        <li>Interrupting control flow is a way to build apps that will respond to a user's actions.</li>
        <li>To provide more than one condition we use an "else if".</li>
        <li>A strict equality operator "===" will check to see if two values are equal and return a Boolean result (true/false).</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data and being able to store data in this way is a fundamental feature of JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Arrays are very helpful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
        <li>One array can store multiple types of data but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
